# TellStones

This repo is based on the newly released game called "TellStones" released by Riot Games.

This game is normally played as a board game, but I wanted to transition it into a computer game as a learning experience.

More info about the game as well as the manual can be found here:

Currently it still contains a lot of bugs, but I'm working on removing them.

I've tried to implement Design patterns, clean coding and commenting to keep everything readable and maintainable.
